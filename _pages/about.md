Starting from September 2021, I joined the [Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge University (UK) as a  Research Associate, within the [Precision Medicine and Inference for Complex Outcomes (PREM)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/research-and-development/prem-precision-medicine-and-inference-for-complex-outcomes/) group. I work with [Dr. Brian Tom](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/brian-tom/) and [Prof. Sylvia Richardson](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/sylvia-richardson/).

I am part of the "STEpUP OA" collaboration, led by the Kennedy Institute at Oxford University, that aims at identifying molecular pathways of osteoarthritis (OA).  This academic-industry partnership will use statistical and machine learning approaches to confirm whether multiple distinct molecular endotypes exist in disease or whether OA is “one disease” at the molecular level. 

I obtained my PhD in Statistics cum laude from Bocconi University in Milan, Italy, in February 2022. My advisor is [Prof. Marco Bonetti](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/docenti/cv.php?rif=50573). My PhD thesis focuses on likelihood-free estimation of statistical models for the natural history of breast cancer, using mammography screening data. 

Previously, I've obtained a Bachelor in Mathematics and then a Master in Statistics, both at Padua University in Italy, and
I've spent a semester as an Erasmus student at KU Leuven, Belgium.

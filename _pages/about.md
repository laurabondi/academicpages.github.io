Starting from September 2021, I joined the [Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge University (UK) as a  Research Associate, within the [Precision Medicine and Inference for Complex Outcomes (PREM)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/research-and-development/prem-precision-medicine-and-inference-for-complex-outcomes/) group. I work with [Dr. Brian Tom](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/brian-tom/) and [Prof. Sylvia Richardson](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/sylvia-richardson/).

I am part of the "STEpUP OA" collaboration, led by the Kennedy Institute at Oxford University, that aims at identifying molecular pathways of osteoarthritis (OA).  This academic-industry partnership will use statistical and machine learning approaches to confirm whether multiple distinct molecular endotypes exist in disease or whether OA is “one disease” at the molecular level. 

I'm a PhD candidate in Statistics at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. My supervisor is [Prof. Marco Bonetti](http://didattica.unibocconi.eu/docenti/cv.php?rif=50573). My PhD thesis focuses on likelihood-free estimation of statistical models for the natural history of breast cancer, using mammography screening data. I am supposed to formally defend my thesis and achieve the PhD title in January 2022.

Previously, I've obtained a Bachelor in Mathematics and then a Master in Statistics, both at Padua University in Italy, and
I've spent a semester as an Erasmus student at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I’ve worked on my Master’s Thesis "Kernel estimation of quantile regression curves using copula modeling" under the supervision of Prof. Irène Gijbels.
